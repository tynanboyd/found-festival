8.0.0.0 - 2017-06-13 - Dustin Bolton
	PROFILES
		New "Smart Profiles" Themes, Plugins, Media for backing up files of each respective type/location:
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/c866aeb96c8d47dd86d44dbd66b3274b.png
			Use the new default smart profiles or create your own for further customizing. These new profile types allow you to automatically only backup this section of the site, allowing for more granular control over what is backed up by a profile. Paired with scheduling this allows you to easily break up backup processes into smaller portions for better spreading server load or timeout issues, especially for larger sites. Smart profiles also support directory and file exclusions.
		New "Custom backup root" option for all profile types (except database):
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/af2c0f714183423eb8b04d4c146ad1e6.png
			You can now configure which directory BackupBuddy backs up on a per-profile basis. Prior to this feature you could only backup the entire site and select directories to exclude. You can now select any directory to be backed up, even directories ABOVE the WordPress root (abspath) by using "/../" in the path. This is useful for backing up individual directories, 3rd party applications, or directories outside the WordPress root. This can also be used for more granular control when breaking up backups across multiple profiles for spreading server load or working around timeout issues.
			Global exclusions apply but default but exclusions may be set for just this profile relative to this custom path manually or with the exclusion picker.
		"Full" and "Files" profiles now have three SMART exclusion options: Auto-exclude Media Directory, Auto-exclude Themes Directory, Auto-exclude Plugins Directory for making it easier to exclude directories which can be backed up by other default Profile types.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/5a2b85de30ad4ab281a362630fc038c6.png
		Backup profiles can now individually override the default global backup mode (classic vs modern) on a per-profile basis.

	STASH LIVE
		Significant performance improvements, especially for larger sites. Sites which in the past would run out of memory due to hosting limits are very likely to now operate within server limits.
		A troubleshooting scan is now regularly performed detecting common problems and alerting the user and also providing solutions.
		A new "Troubleshooting Scan" button to upper right of page of Stash Live page is available for manually troubleshooting.

	IMPORTBUDDY:
		New "Search Engine Visibility" setting to Step 6 of restore process, allowing you to either keep the setting as it was on the source site, turn on search engine visibility, or turn it off. Useful for moving sites between development, staging, and live locations.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/a10ff6ca440c4d6a8658eb3ed49c9e33.png
		Added "Forgot password" feature which allows you to generate a new password hash. This hash can then be placed inside the importbuddy.php file to make it usable even if you forgot its password.

		Javascript errors are now automatically detected and brought to the user's attention as well as logged to aid in troubleshooting. Sometimes various browser plugins running javascript fail causing importbuddy.php's javascript to halt.
		Improved look and feel with animated progress as well as highlights to areas that require user attention.
		importbuddy.php file size has been reduced for faster uploading during restore process.
	GENERAL
		Directory exclusions (both global and profiles) support three new variables: {media}, {theme}, and {plugins} to exclude those specific WordPress directories.

		Selection of plugins to push/pull now only lists plugins that either do not exist on the destination or differ in version.
	DROPBOX:
